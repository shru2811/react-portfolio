            Iâ€™m a final-year BTech Computer Science student with a strong foundation in Java, web development, and data structures. I recently completed a rewarding internship at Dell Technologies, where I not only gained hands-on experience in real-world software projects but also participated in internal competitions that sharpened my skills and expanded my network.

            My core interests lie in frontend development and the integration of generative AI to create meaningful, visually striking, and intelligent digital products. I also enjoy mentoring juniors and sharing knowledge, which helps me grow while giving back to the tech community. With a blend of creativity and engineering mindset, I aim to build software that solves real problems and leaves a lasting impact.
